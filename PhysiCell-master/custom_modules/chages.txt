done::

change oxygen continues in normal tissue to ~90 mmHg
 *** need to fix in coarse vasculature 

chanage RFP and GFP time scales to 24-hour half-life (up and down)

set GFP / RFP switch to 5 mmHg 

set motiltiy to 0.05 or 0.10 micron/minute

hypoxic cells secrete VEGF at the same hypoxic switch value (set to independent?)




to do::
improve the "memory model"

finish angiogenesis 

ECM bias for the future? 

"bumper cars" to set low persistence in higher-pressure areas 

tumor motiltiy on in happy cells but wiht no bias?
