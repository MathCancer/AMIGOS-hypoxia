\section{Assumptions and Questions}
\begin{enumerate}

\item 
A: All cells initially express RFP

\item 
A: Oxygen below 10 mmHg turns off expression of RFP, turns on expression of GFP

\item 
Q: What's a time scale for protein synthesis? (Early on, it's time to transcribe RNA, then synthesize protein. Later, it's time to just synthesize protein from already existent RNA.) 

\item 
Q: What's the time scale for protein degradation? 

\item 
Q: In 10 mmHg, does RFP gene get snipped out immediately and GFP gene enabled, or is there a mean time delay?
