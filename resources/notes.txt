cancer cells invade at 14-20 micron/hour (at edge)

cells at leading edge have faster velocity. (Daniele)


Now, look at protein_Measures_for_paul

Looking at the RFP and GFP curves, it seems like: 

1) The RFP decay half life is on the order of a week

2) It takes maybe 1-1.5 days to double GFP expression

3) There may be some lag before low O2 change to GFP gene expression and protein expression, but maybe let's not get too fancy! 

Does this seem reasonable?


Next, by Daniele's talk and plots: 

* pO2 ~ 85 mmHg in the normal tissue. 

* it drops from ~70 mmHg to 20 mmHg in about 1.1 mm. 

* eagle eyeing it: 250-200 microns from 70 mmHg at edge to 38 mmHg (perinecrotic)

* about 1 more mm to get 10 mmHg (RFP -> GFP) 




other notes;


1) how do we tune migration? [done for now]
* email thread says overall rate of movement is ~0.05 micron/minute. 
* we start with this, but may increase to account for randomness
+ models will need to test ideas of "who" is migrating. 
+ what does it take to still get a necrotic core? 

2) need to formalize the "memory" more [not done]

3) need to implement "bumper cars" [not done]

4) need to recalibrate RFP / GFP switching times [done for now]
* about 48 hours to complete
+ we implement to have 90% done at 48 hours for now
+ Daniele needs to get us more tracking data

5) need to finish up basic angiogenesis model [in progresss] 

6) need to start calibration oxygenation [in progress]
* I calibrated the far-field conditions, fixed boundary code
+ need to debug on OSX

I'll work on #2 and #3 tonight, perhaps work more on #6. 

John, please let me know your plans. 

Also, we should discuss the NCI pilot with Daniele.

Cool!

Wow, that’s a lot slower! 

500 microns / (7 days * 24 hours * 60 min ) ~ 0.05 micron / min. You nailed it—about 1/10 less! 

Maybe we use something slightly higher since they won’t be traveling straight lines???
